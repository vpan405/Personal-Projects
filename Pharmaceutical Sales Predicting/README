GOAL: Build a machine learning model to forecast pharmaceutical sales based on features such as Product Class, Channel, 
      Distributor, Quantity, etc.
Accomplished Objectives:
- Data loading and preprocessing 
- Exploratory visualizations (heatmaps, boxplots) 
- Machine learning model (Random Forest) 
- Forecasting for new input 
- Visuals for presentations like: Correlation heatmap 
      - Sales by drug type 
      - Feature importance 
      - Actual vs Predicted Sales scatter plot
